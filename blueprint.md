# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This project is a platform for users to search for recipes and create a shopping list. The application is built as a modern, framework-less web application using the Spoonacular API for recipe data and the Pexels API for high-quality imagery.

## Implemented Features
- **Web Components**: A `recipe-platform` custom element that encapsulates all application logic.
- **Advanced Recipe Search**: Fetches and filters recipes from the Spoonacular API by query, cuisine, and calorie count.
- **Dynamic Shopping List**: Allows users to generate a shopping list from the ingredients of any selected recipe.
- **Modern Styling**: A responsive, modern design for the user interface.

## Current Plan: Visual & Thematic Overhaul

### Steps
1.  **Update Blueprint**: The `blueprint.md` file will be updated to reflect the plan for a complete visual and thematic overhaul.
2.  **Add Header**: A new header with a prominent, food-themed background image will be added to the main page (`index.html`) to create a strong visual anchor.
3.  **Implement Warm Color Scheme**: The entire application's color palette will be updated in `style.css`. It will feature a warm and inviting theme using colors like warm oranges, soft creams, and deep browns to create a cozy, appetizing feel.
4.  **Integrate Pexels API for Images**: The `recipe-platform` component in `main.js` will be modified to fetch and display high-quality food images from Pexels.com for each recipe card, replacing the default images from the recipe API.
