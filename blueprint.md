# Project Blueprint

## Overview
This is a framework-less web project developed within the Firebase Studio environment by an AI agent. The project aims to demonstrate modern web development practices including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Components.

## Implemented Features
### Initial Web Page
- A basic `index.html` file with a title, a main heading, and a paragraph.
- Links to `style.css` for styling and `main.js` for scripting.
- `style.css` provides basic styling for the body, headings, and paragraphs.
- `main.js` includes a `DOMContentLoaded` listener that logs a message to the console.

### Web Component: SimpleGreeting
- A `SimpleGreeting` custom element is defined in `main.js`.
- It uses Shadow DOM for encapsulation and displays a personalized greeting.
- The custom element `<simple-greeting name="User"></simple-greeting>` is used in `index.html`.

## Current Plan
The project is currently up-to-date with the implemented features. No further changes are planned at this moment.
